We propose a compositional solution to the strategy synthesis problem for LTL specifications in the cooperative (heterogeneous) multi-agent scenario. A main challenge of the general strategy synthesis approach is the state-space explosion occurring during construction of a global model for agents with different, mutually dependent goals. Given a set of agents and their individual goal specifications represented through a local model and an LTL formula, we compute a compliant set of strategies that fulfill each agents' goal specification. We avoid the state-space explosion by computing individual solutions for each agent separately and then composing these solutions. During the initial strategy computation, assumptions over the states of other agents not represented in the local model are generated only where needed. These assumptions are resolved during composition of the individual solutions to assure compliance of the computed strategies. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in several simulation case studies and compared to the classical, monolithic approach.
